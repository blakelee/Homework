# Homework (tentative name)

This app is intended to be a day planner for your school classes.

Some of the problems I didn't like about other apps were that they didn't display information neatly. I intend to make a UI that is both simple and pleasing to the eye. Another problem I had was that I would get a notification that something is due and dismiss it. However, if you're like me, you dismiss it, then forget about it. So I intend to create a system to completely harrass you until you are absolutely sure that you don't want anymore notifications. This can be user customizable of course.

The style of this app will loosely follow the app Studios by Braden Young in the Google Play Store.

I also want a class details screen that has an optional picture of the building the class is in as well as information about the class like time, email, location, professor phone number, office hours, etc. Because who likes going through a syllabus everytime you want to check for that information? It will also have the ability to link to a syllabus as well so you can pull it up without having to dig through your recent downloads.
